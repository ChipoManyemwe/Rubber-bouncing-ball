# 🏀 Bouncing Ball Animation  

This project features a **bouncing ball animation** created in **Autodesk Maya**.  
It demonstrates the principles of **timing, squash and stretch, and motion arcs** to simulate realistic bounce movement.

## 🧰 Tools Used  
- Autodesk Maya  
- Graph Editor (for motion curves)  
- Arnold Renderer  

## 💡 Highlights  
- Applied the **12 Principles of Animation**, focusing on **timing and spacing**  
- Used **keyframes** to simulate bounce height and gravity  
- Rendered with realistic lighting and shading

## ✨ Description  
This exercise strengthened my understanding of **physics-based motion** in animation, exploring realism through **weight, rebound energy**, and **deceleration**.
